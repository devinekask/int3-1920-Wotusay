      <p>The bartender’s smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it. The antique arm whined as he reached for another mug. It was a Russian military prosthesis, a seven-function force-feedback manipulator, cased in grubby pink plastic. "You are too much the artiste, Herr Case." Ratz grunted; the sound served him as laughter. He scratched his overhang of white-shirted belly with the pink claw. "You are the artiste of the slightly funny deal."</p>
      <p>"Sure," Case said, and sipped his beer. "Somebody’s gotta be funny around here. Sure the fuck isn’t you." The whore’s giggle went up an octave."Isn’t you either, sister. So you vanish, okay? Zone, he’s a close personal friend of mine."She looked Case in the eye and made the softest possible spitting sound, her lips barely moving. But she left. "Jesus," Case said, "what kind a creep joint you running here? Man can’t have a drink." "Ha," Ratz said, swabbing the scarred wood with a rag, "Zone shows a percentage. You I let work here for entertainment value." As Case was picking up his beer, one of those strange instants of silence descended, as though a hundred unrelated conversations had simultaneously arrived at the same <span class="shake">pause</span></p>

      <p>The Japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than the Chinese had ever known. The black clinics of Chiba were the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly, and still they couldn’t repair the damage he’d suffered in that Memphis hotel. A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he’d taken and the corners he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that <span class="flickering">collorless</span> void . . . The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn’t there.</p>

      <p>Hello, my name is Wout. Sorry that i disturbed your ‘<span class="flickering">fun</span>’ reading experience. You know why i stop it?  Because i want to tell you how the book really is. The book starts off with a cool beginning that thing u just read. But to be honest arent we living like this already?  Gibson visioned the future in a way we never expected to be. And look at us now. We are all slaves of the society we live in. Fake news every were we look, False elections, etc.</p>
      <p>This book tells it all. An expemple is that the most wealthy men have the saying in the world. And its just like in the real world we live in today. If you cant see it that means you are blind. Or you just haven’t noticed. This book describes the futur of us. If we keep living like this. This can and will happen if we dont change anything.</p>

        <p>Today’s most famous <span class="scifi">scifi worlds</span>are created on the cinema screen, or in the virtual realities of video games. There’s a genuine irony that, while Gibson partly created our ideas of cyberspace and virtual reality, the world of the Sprawl has remained a stubbornly linguistic universe. A place we enter through printed words on the page, thanks only to the visionary inventiveness - and technical mastery - of Gibson’s writing.

        <p>The reason why u should pick up this book and just read are endless. Many films, tv-shows even music is inspired of this book. Maybe it can inspire you to something greater then u ever imagined</p>
        <p>Lets talk about the <span class="chars">characters</span> of this book. The novel begins with Case, a former console Cowboy. He now works as a middelman for smugglers and drugdealers. Case misses his old job but was forced out after stealing from his bosses, who punished him by destroying his nervous system, preventing him form ever jacking into the matrix again.
        </p>
        <p>Then Molly changes everything. Molly is a razorgirl who works for Armtiage.a <span class="glitch">mysterious</span> ex-military point man, whose secret and shady employer has tasked him with assembling a team to carry off a series of heists. Armitage promises to restore Case’s nervous system, allowing him to jack into the matrix once again, and Case immediately signs on.</p>

      <p>Home was BAMA, the Sprawl, the Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis.Program a map to display frequency of data exchange, every thousand megabytes a single pixel on a very large screen. Manhattan and Atlanta burn solid white. Then they start to pulse, the rate of traffic threatening to overload your simulation. Your map is about to go nova. Cool it down. Up your scale. Each pixel a million megabytes. At a hundred million megabytes per second, you begin to make out certain blocks in midtown Manhattan, outlines of hundred-year-old industrial parks ringing the old core of Atlanta . . .</p>
      <p>Case woke from a dream of <span class="glith">airports</span>, of Molly’s dark leathers moving ahead of him through the concourses of Narita, Schipol, Orly . . . He watched himself buy a flat plastic flask of Danish vodka at some kiosk, an hour before dawn. Somewhere down in the Sprawl’s ferro-concrete roots, a train drove a column of stale air through a tunnel. The train itself was silent, gliding over its induction cushion, but displaced air made the tunnel sing, bass down into subsonics. Vibration reached the room where he lay and caused dust to rise from the cracks in the desiccated parquet floor.</p>
      <p>Opening his eyes, he saw Molly, naked and just out of reach across an expanse of very new pink temper foam. Overhead, sunlight filtered through the soot-stained grid of a <span class="scifi">skylight</span> . One half-meter square of glass had been replaced with chip-board, a fat gray cable emerging there to dangle within a few centimeters of the floor. He lay on his side and watched her breathe, her <span class="breast">breast</span>, the sweep of a flank defined with the functional elegance of a war plane’s fuselage. Her body was spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer’s.</p>

      <p>The room was <span class="flickering">large</span>. He sat up. The room was empty, aside from the wide pink bedslab and two nylon bags, new and identical, that lay beside it. Blank walls, no windows, a single white-painted steel fire door. The walls were coated with countless layers of white latex paint. Factory space. He knew this kind of room, this kind of building; the tenants would operate in the inter zone where art wasn’t quite crime, crime not quite art. He was home.</p>
      <p>He swung his feet to the floor. It was made of little blocks of wood, some missing, others loose. His head ached. He remembered Amsterdam, another room, in the Old City section of the Centrum, buildings centuries old. Molly back from the canal’s edge with orange juice and eggs. Armitage off on some <span class="flickering">cryptic</span> foray, the two of them walking alone past Dam Square to a bar she knew on a Damrak thoroughfare. Paris was a blurred dream. Shopping.</p>
      <p>She’d taken him shopping. He stood, pulling on a wrinkled pair of new black jeans that lay at his feet, and knelt beside the bags. The ffirst one he opened was Molly’s: neatly folded clothing and small expensive-looking gadgets. The second was stuffed with things he didn’t remember buying: books, tapes, a Simstim deck, clothing with French and Italian labels. Beneath a green t-shirt, he discovered a flat, origami-wrapped package, recycled Japanese paper.</p>

      <p>As you can read this the <span class="chars">last chapter</span>. This is the end thought about the book: Neuromancer. Personally i discoverd more and more about the genre cyberpunk. This is to be honest one of the best genres i know. Its so realstic. Because it can all happen if we are not carefull. These days all companys are getting so much power its insane.
    </p>
      <p>In the book the rich live in a big mansion in the sky and the poor live on the soil. This is a little reference to our society. The poor live in suburbs were cirme is an all time high and the rich live in a closed domain were security is 24/7. This book is full of references that we have <span class="shake">in this time</span> . </p>
      <p>The book opens your eyes in every single way. With some fun little fantasy makes this one of the greatest 1984 books in the history. These are not all the chapters form the book i dont want to tell the whole story i want to set you on a journey in the book itself.</p>
